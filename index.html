                Well, my name is Ahmed Safy Aldean Haifz, A sudanese
                ,at this date 3/14/2023 I'm 18 years old, I Study IT in future university, And at the same date
                I'm in the first semester, besides the university, I'm a GamesDeveloper, and a Front-End Developer,
                I made a lot of games in my career, but I published just a few of them, And also I learned 3D modeling
                and animating, And after all,
                I can say that gameDev is the best thing that ever happend to me.

                    <p> Well, Moho was None of my interests but it still was a good experiment, my friend abbas who made
                        me
                        get into it, and by the way Moho is a 2d aniamtion program,
                        I made some things with it but, it wasn' what I wanted to do,
                        I mean 2d animating didn't fit me, And I didn't really like 2d aniamtion,
                        but
                        like I said it was a good experiment</p>

                    <p>Uinty was the best thing ever happend to me, I remmber that before I learned unity I wanted to
                        make video games but I did't know how so I searched, then I found that I need to learn c#
                        programming language, and I learned it, it was kind of hard because it was my firs programming
                        languge to learn, but now at game development I guess you can call me a pro game developer</p>

                    <p>Blender was for me the door to animation world, and it was before the unity, the begining of it
                        was when me and my friend abbas really wanted to make 3d animation, then we desided to work in
                        blender, it wasn't easy at all, but it was fun, we had a big time with blender but we have not
                        reached the limit that we can call our selfs a pro animators</p>
